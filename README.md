## Abstract
Our project aims to assist applicants that suffer from bad credit or the inability to gain a credit card understand which variable majorly impact their eligibility. In addition, it focuses on comparing different analytical models/methods to understand which one performs best in deciphering how a company approves or denies applicants requests for credit cards. Using data that display applicant’s information such as such as credit score, income, hold balance, help identify the criteria used by a company to determine eligibility. This project compares four different models/methods: logistic regression (LR) model, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and random forest method. Results show that random forest model yields to higher accuracy rate (99.4%) compared to other models (LR = 95.2%, LDA= 93.8%, KNN = 83.7%). The two top performing models helped determining that the most impactful variable to influence credit card eligibility is preferred customer probability.
